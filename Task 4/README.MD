 To design a highly scalable infrastructure for the BlogApp application with the ability to handle 1,000,000 concurrent users, we can leverage various AWS services

1. Load Balancer:
   - Utilize an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the application.
   - ELB automatically scales to handle the incoming requests and provides high availability.

2. Auto Scaling Group:
   - Use an Auto Scaling group to automatically scale the number of instances based on the demand.
   - Configure the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on CPU utilization or other metrics.
   - This ensures that the infrastructure can handle the increased load during peak times and scale down during low demand.

3. EC2 Instances:
   - Launch multiple EC2 instances to host the BlogApp application.
   - These instances will be behind the load balancer and serve the incoming requests.
   - The number of instances can scale up or down based on the Auto Scaling group configuration.

4. RDS Database:
   - Utilize Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) to host the application's database.
   - RDS provides managed database services and can handle the increased load with automatic scaling capabilities.
